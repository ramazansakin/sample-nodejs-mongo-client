# Sample NodeJs project via MongoDB

  Sample nodeJs project with mongoDB is to show integrating kafta to nodeJs and communication via Spring boot cloud project.
Because spring boot side is microservices architecture, we can use any technologies we are familier with mostly and
easy to integrate them via Kafka, RestTemplate, Redis or any other message queue techs.

You can run this app via creating a mongoDB database and reconfigure app.js
You have 3 options to be able to use mongoDb:

- using embedded mongoDB (the easiest way to set up and start to use)
- using mongoDB via normally set up
- using mlab.com to get a free space for mongoDb cluster

.. may be there are more options but I can give these.

And you can communicate my other spring cloud project with this app. That is, this is an also another microservice.
Like this, we can also use ant other techs together via microservices architect.
